- 52 = Lens width
- 18 = Bridge width
- 140 = Temple length

Face width = Lens + Bridge + Lens
Example: 52 + 18 + 52 = 122mm

**No Glasses to Measure?**

- Measure face at widest point (cheekbones)
- Or use a credit card:
  - Card = 86mm wide
  - Face 1.5 cards wide = Small
  - Face 1.6 cards wide = Medium
  - Face 1.7+ cards wide = Large

### Article 8.4: Tips for Optimal Audio Quality

**Title:** Tips for Optimal Audio Quality
**Category:** Getting Started
**Tags:** audio, sound, quality, tips

---

**Understanding Open-Ear Audio**

Lucyd glasses use open-ear speakers that direct sound toward your ears while keeping them uncovered. This is different from headphones or earbuds.

**Best Practices**

**1. Proper Fit**
- Glasses should sit securely on your nose and ears
- Temples should rest close to your head
- Speaker area should align with your ear opening

**2. Volume Balance**
- Increase glasses volume (tap right temple)
- Adjust phone media volume separately
- Start at 50% and adjust up

**3. Environment Matters**
- Works best in moderate noise levels
- Very loud environments may overpower audio
- Quiet settings allow lower volume

**4. Ear Positioning**
- Speakers are on the inside of temples
- Make sure temples are positioned near ears
- Try slight adjustments for best sound

**Audio Expectations**
- Great for calls, podcasts, audiobooks
- Sufficient bass for casual music listening
- Not designed to replace studio headphones

### Article 8.16: Audio Sounds Tinny or Lacks Bass

**Title:** Audio Sounds Tinny or Lacks Bass
**Category:** Technical Support
**Tags:** audio, tinny, bass, quality

---

**Understanding Open-Ear Audio**

Lucyd uses open-ear speakers. This design:
- Keeps ears uncovered for awareness
- Directs sound toward ear canal
- Has less bass than over-ear headphones

**This Is Normal:**
- Less pronounced bass
- Sound slightly different from earbuds
- Can hear environment while listening

**Improve Your Audio**

**1. Check Positioning**
- Temple speaker should point toward ear opening
- Glasses should fit snugly
- Try adjusting glasses position slightly

**2. Maximize Volume**
- Increase glasses volume (tap right temple)
- Increase phone media volume
- Check app equalizer settings if available

**3. Update Firmware**
- Open Lucyd app
- Check for firmware updates
- Install any available updates

**4. Try Different Content**
- Some audio is mastered with heavy bass
- Test with various music types
- Podcasts/audiobooks may sound better

**Not What You Expected?**

If audio seems actually broken (distorted, cutting out), see "No Audio / Sound Issues" troubleshooting.

### Article 8.17: Volume Too Low at Max

**Title:** Volume Too Low at Maximum
**Category:** Technical Support
**Tags:** volume, quiet, low

---

**Maximize Your Volume**

**Check Both Volume Controls**

There are TWO volume levels:
1. **Phone volume** - Media/ringer on your device
2. **Glasses volume** - Controlled via temple taps

Both need to be turned up!

**Phone Settings**

**iPhone:**
- Settings > Sounds & Haptics
- Ensure "Change with Buttons" is ON
- Check Media volume (not just ringer)

**Android:**
- Settings > Sound
- Check Media volume slider
- May have separate Bluetooth volume

**Glasses Volume**
- Tap and hold RIGHT temple to increase
- Listen for "volume max" confirmation
- Note: Tapping too fast may trigger other controls

**Still Too Quiet?**

1. **Update firmware** via Lucyd app
2. **Factory reset** (hold both buttons 10 sec)
3. **Check audio balance** in phone accessibility settings
4. **Test with different apps** (Spotify vs YouTube vs calls)

**Design Consideration**

Open-ear speakers prioritize awareness over isolation. In very loud environments, this limits effective volume.

   - Reconnect Bluetooth

**Test Your Microphone**

1. Make a test call
2. Or record a voice memo
3. Verify audio routes to glasses (not phone)

**On iPhone:**
- During call, check audio routing icon
- Should show headset, not phone speaker

**On Android:**
- During call, check audio output setting
- Select Lucyd/Bluetooth option

**Still Not Working?**

1. **Factory reset**: Hold both buttons 10 seconds

### Article 8.27: What Is Open-Ear Audio Technology?

**Title:** What Is Open-Ear Audio Technology?
**Category:** Product Information
**Tags:** open-ear, audio, technology, how it works

---

**Understanding Open-Ear Audio**

Lucyd glasses use open-ear audio technology, which is fundamentally different from traditional headphones.

**How It Works**

Instead of sealing your ear canal (like earbuds) or covering your ears (like headphones), Lucyd uses:
- Directional speakers in the temples
- Audio waves directed toward your ear canal
- Your ears remain completely open

**Benefits**

**Situational Awareness**
- Hear your surroundings
- Safer for walking, cycling, working
- Can have conversations while wearing

**Comfort**
- No ear fatigue from earbuds
- No sweaty ears from headphones
- All-day wearable

**Hygiene**
- Nothing inside your ear canal
- Easy to clean
- No ear infection concerns

**Convenience**
- Always on your face
- No separate device to carry
- Instant access to audio

**What to Expect**

**Great For:**
- Phone calls
- Podcasts and audiobooks
- Casual music listening
- Navigation directions
- Voice assistants

**Not Designed For:**
- Noise isolation
- Studio-quality music
- Blocking out environment
- Very loud environments

### Article 8.30: Using Lucyd While Driving

**Title:** Using Lucyd Glasses While Driving
**Category:** Product Information
**Tags:** driving, safety, legal

---

**Driving with Lucyd Glasses**

**Legal Considerations**

Using Lucyd for audio while driving is similar to using your car radio or Bluetooth headset in most jurisdictions. However:
- Laws vary by state/country
- Some areas restrict any ear-covering devices
- Check your local regulations

**Open-Ear Advantage**

Lucyd's open-ear design means:
- You can hear traffic and sirens
- Conversations with passengers are possible
- Better situational awareness than earbuds

**Safe Use While Driving**

**DO:**
- Set up navigation before driving
- Use voice commands for calls
- Keep volume at reasonable level
- Focus on the road first

**DON'T:**
- Manually adjust glasses while driving
- Watch videos (obviously)
- Let audio distract from driving
- Use at volumes that block traffic sounds

**Phone Calls**

Answer/end calls with single tap:
- Keeps hands on wheel
- Safer than holding phone
- Built-in microphone for clear calls

**Navigation**

Get directions through your glasses:
- Connect to Google Maps or Apple Maps
- Hear turn-by-turn directions
- Keep eyes on road, not phone

**Note on Photochromic Lenses**

If you have photochromic (transition) lenses:
- They may NOT darken in car
- Windshields block UV that triggers darkening
- Consider polarized lenses for driving instead

**Title:** Glasses Disconnecting Frequently
**Category:** Technical Support
**Tags:** disconnect, dropping, unstable, connection

---

**Frequent Disconnections?**

If your Lucyd glasses keep disconnecting from your phone, try these fixes in order.

**Step 1: Check Distance**
- Stay within 30 feet of phone
- Bluetooth works best within 10 feet
- Walls and obstacles reduce range

**Step 2: Reduce Interference**
- Move away from WiFi routers
- Turn off other Bluetooth devices
- Avoid areas with many wireless devices

**Step 3: Update Everything**
- Update phone to latest OS
- Update Lucyd app
- Update glasses firmware via app

**Step 4: Re-pair Connection**
1. Forget "Lucyd" in phone Bluetooth
2. Factory reset glasses (hold both buttons 10 sec)
3. Pair fresh from scratch

**Step 5: Check Battery**

### Article 8.32: How to Connect to a New Device

**Title:** How to Connect to a New Device
**Category:** Technical Support
**Tags:** new device, second phone, additional

---

**Pairing with a New/Additional Device**

**Method 1: Fresh Pairing (Recommended)**

1. On current device, go to Bluetooth and "Forget" Lucyd
2. Put glasses in pairing mode (hold button 5 seconds)
3. On new device, enable Bluetooth
4. Select "Lucyd" from available devices
5. Confirm connection

**Method 2: Keep Both Devices Paired**

Your Lucyd glasses can remember multiple devices:

1. Disconnect from current device (just turn off Bluetooth)
2. Put glasses in pairing mode
3. Pair new device
4. Both devices stay in memory
5. Glasses connect to whichever is active

**Switching Between Devices**

- Glasses auto-connect to last used device
- To switch: disconnect one, connect on other
- Only one active connection at a time

**Limits**
- Maximum 8 paired devices stored
- When adding 9th, oldest is removed

### Article 8.33: Battery Draining Too Quickly

**Title:** Battery Draining Too Quickly
**Category:** Technical Support
**Tags:** battery, drain, fast

---

**Battery Life Shorter Than Expected?**

**Normal Battery Life**
- Music: 6-8 hours
- Calls: 4-5 hours
- Mixed: 5-6 hours

If significantly less, try these fixes:

**Reduce Power Consumption**

1. **Lower Volume**
   - Higher volume = faster drain
   - Try 70% instead of 100%

2. **Stay Close to Phone**
   - Bluetooth uses more power at distance
   - Keep phone within 10 feet

3. **Turn Off When Not Using**
   - Standby still uses some power
   - Power off for long breaks

4. **Update Firmware**
   - Updates often include battery optimizations
   - Check Lucyd app for updates

**Check Battery Health**

Battery capacity naturally decreases:
- Year 1: Full capacity
- Year 2: ~80% capacity
- Year 3+: Further reduction

**Possible Hardware Issue**

If battery drains in 1-2 hours when new:
- May be defective battery
- Contact warranty support
- Provide order number and purchase date

### Article 9.3: Warranty vs Accidental Damage: What's Covered?

**Title:** Warranty vs Accidental Damage: What's Covered?
**Category:** Warranty & Protection
**Tags:** warranty, accidental, coverage, damage, defect

---

**Understanding what's covered helps set expectations and speeds up your claim.**

**Manufacturing Defect (WARRANTY COVERED)**

A manufacturing defect means the product failed due to a flaw in materials or workmanship, NOT from external force.

**Examples of covered defects:**
- Hinge breaks during normal open/close action
- Frame cracks at a stress point without any impact
- Temple snaps while being worn or adjusted normally
- Nose bridge separates without being bent or dropped
- Screws fall out repeatedly despite being tightened
- Frame warps or bends permanently from normal body heat

**Key indicator:** The damage happened during normal, everyday use with no external force or accident.

**Accidental Damage (NOT WARRANTY COVERED)**

Accidental damage results from external force, misuse, or events beyond normal wear.

**Examples of accidental damage:**
- Dropped glasses and frame cracked
- Sat on glasses
- Stepped on glasses
- Glasses fell off head onto hard surface
- Pet chewed on frames
- Stored in back pocket and broke
- Bent frames trying to adjust fit
- Damage from extreme heat (left in hot car)

**How We Determine the Cause**

We look at:
1. **Break pattern** - Clean snaps at stress points suggest defects; irregular breaks suggest impact
2. **Location** - Known weak points vs unusual locations
3. **Timeline** - Defects typically appear within months; impact damage is immediate
4. **Photos** - Visual evidence of the damage type

**What If I Disagree?**

If you believe your damage is a manufacturing defect and we've classified it as accidental:
- You can request a second review
- Provide additional context or photos
- Our team will re-evaluate

**Coverage Summary**

| Covered (Warranty) | Not Covered (Accidental) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Hinge failure | Drops and impacts |
| Stress cracks | Sitting/stepping on |
| Joint separation | Bending/forcing |
| Screw failure | Pet damage |
| Material fatigue | Heat damage |
| Normal use breakage | Water submersion damage |

**Have Lucyd Pro Insurance?**

Lucyd Pro covers BOTH manufacturing defects AND accidental damage. If you purchased Lucyd Pro, you're covered either way!

### Article 9.4: Frame Damage Assessment Guide (Internal Reference)

**Title:** Frame Damage Assessment Guide
**Category:** Warranty & Protection
**Tags:** internal, assessment, damage, warranty, guide

---

**This guide helps you understand how we assess frame damage claims.**

**Common Frame Failure Points**

| Location | Common Cause | Usually Defect? |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hinge joint | Repeated open/close | Yes, if <12 months |
| Temple mid-point | Flexing/bending | Depends on force |
| Nose bridge | Stress from wear | Yes, if no impact |
| Frame front corners | Impact point | Usually accidental |
| Screw holes | Material fatigue | Yes |

**Frame Materials & Expected Durability**

Lucyd frames are designed for everyday use including:
- Daily wearing and removing
- Normal adjustment for fit
- Cleaning and handling
- Carrying in a pouch or case

**When to Suspect a Defect**

- Damage appears within the first 6 months
- Break occurs at a known stress point (hinge, joint)
- Customer describes normal use when damage occurred
- Similar reports from same batch/model
- Clean break pattern consistent with material failure

**When to Suspect Accidental Damage**

- Impact marks visible near break point
- Customer mentions a drop, sit-on, or similar event
- Break pattern shows external force (splintering, crushing)
- Damage at unusual location (not a stress point)
- Cosmetic scratches/scuffs suggesting rough handling

**Assessment Process**

1. Request photos (see photo guide article)
2. Check purchase date and order history
3. Review customer's description of events
4. Examine break pattern in photos
5. Check for known issues with that model/batch
6. Make determination and communicate clearly

### Article 9.5: Broken Frames FAQ: Hinges, Temples, Nose Bridge

**Title:** Broken Frames FAQ: Hinges, Temples, Nose Bridge
**Category:** Warranty & Protection
**Tags:** broken, hinge, temple, nose bridge, FAQ

---

**Common questions about specific types of frame damage.**

**Hinge Issues**

**Q: My hinge is loose. What should I do?**
A: A loose hinge can sometimes be tightened. Try using a small eyeglass screwdriver on the hinge screw. If the screw won't hold or keeps loosening, contact us -- this may be a warranty issue.

**Q: The hinge broke completely. Is this covered?**
A: If the hinge broke during normal use (opening/closing your glasses), this is typically a manufacturing defect covered under warranty. Send us photos and your order number.

**Q: Can a broken hinge be repaired?**
A: In some cases, yes. Send photos and we'll assess whether repair is possible or if a full replacement is needed.

**Temple (Arm) Issues**

**Q: One temple snapped off. Now what?**
A: This depends on how it happened:
- Broke during normal wear → Likely warranty covered
- Broke from a drop or impact → Accidental damage (see options in "My Frames Are Broken" article)

**Q: Can I get just one replacement temple?**
A: Due to the electronics in each temple, individual temple replacement isn't available. We replace the full pair.

**Q: The temple is bent. Can I straighten it?**
A: Light bending for fit adjustment is okay. If the temple is significantly bent from an impact, don't force it -- this can cause further damage. Contact us for options.

**Nose Bridge Issues**

**Q: The nose bridge cracked. What are my options?**
A: Nose bridge cracks during normal wear are typically covered under warranty. Contact us with photos and your order number.

**Q: The nose pads fell off. Can I replace them?**

### Article 9.9: Lucyd Pro Insurance: Is It Worth It?

**Title:** Lucyd Pro Insurance: Is It Worth It?
**Category:** Warranty & Protection
**Tags:** insurance, Lucyd Pro, worth it, protection, value

---

**Wondering if Lucyd Pro is a smart purchase? Here's an honest breakdown.**

**What Lucyd Pro Adds Beyond Standard Warranty**

| Protection | Standard Warranty (Free) | Lucyd Pro (Paid) |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Manufacturing defects | ✅ 1 year | ✅ 2 years |
| Accidental drops | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cracked/broken frames | ❌ (if accidental) | ✅ |
| Water damage | ❌ | ✅ |
| Theft | ❌ | ✅ (with police report) |

**The Big Question: Frames**

25% of all support tickets involve broken frames. Without Lucyd Pro:
- Accidental frame damage = no free replacement
- You'll need to purchase a new pair or pay for repair
- Replacement cost is full retail price

With Lucyd Pro:
- Accidental frame damage = small deductible for replacement
- Covers drops, impacts, and accidents
- 2 claims during coverage period

**Who Should Get Lucyd Pro?**

**Strongly recommended if you:**
- Are active or play sports while wearing glasses
- Have a history of breaking glasses
- Chose Lucyd as your only pair of glasses
- Ordered expensive prescription lenses
- Work in environments where damage is likely
- Travel frequently

**May not need it if you:**
- Are very careful with eyewear
- Have backup glasses
- Primarily use indoors at a desk
- Ordered non-prescription (lower replacement cost)

**Cost Comparison**

Think about it this way:
- Lucyd Pro cost: A fraction of a new pair
- Replacement without insurance: Full retail price
- If you use even one claim, Lucyd Pro typically saves you money

**How to Purchase**

Lucyd Pro is available at checkout when ordering your glasses. It cannot be added after purchase.

**Bottom Line**

If your Lucyd glasses are your primary eyewear, especially with prescription lenses, Lucyd Pro is a smart investment. The most common damage type (broken frames from accidental causes) is exactly what it covers.

### Article 9.10: Common Frame Issues & When to Contact Us

**Title:** Common Frame Issues & When to Contact Us
**Category:** Warranty & Protection
**Tags:** frame, issues, common, preventive, care

---

**Know what's normal, what's fixable at home, and when to reach out.**

**Normal Wear (No Action Needed)**

These are normal and don't require support:
- Minor scratches on frame surface after months of use
- Nose pads becoming slightly compressed over time
- Slight loosening of fit (can be adjusted)
- Temple tips softening with regular use

**Fixable at Home**

| Issue | DIY Fix |
|-------|---------|
| Loose hinge screw | Tighten with eyeglass screwdriver |
| Loose nose pads | Gently push back into place |
| Temples too tight | Warm gently with hairdryer, bend outward slightly |
| Temples too loose | Warm gently, bend inward slightly |
| Dirty frame | Clean with mild soap and lukewarm water |

**⚠️ Be Gentle:** When adjusting temples, apply minimal force. Excessive bending can cause permanent damage.

**Contact Us For**

| Issue | Priority | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Hinge broken or cracked | High | Likely warranty or replacement needed |
| Temple snapped | High | Cannot be repaired at home |
| Nose bridge cracked | High | Structural damage |
| Frame cracked anywhere | High | Replacement needed |
| Screw won't hold despite tightening | Medium | May need thread repair |
| Frame bent significantly | Medium | May affect electronics |
| Repeated same issue | Medium | Quality concern |

**Preventive Care Tips**

1. **Always use two hands** to put on and remove glasses
2. **Store in the pouch** when not wearing
3. **Never place face-down** on hard surfaces
4. **Don't push up on the bridge** with one finger (stresses the frame)
5. **Avoid leaving in hot cars** (heat can warp frames)
6. **Don't wear on top of head** (stretches temples)
7. **Clean regularly** (sweat and oils can degrade materials)

**When Frame Damage Is Urgent**

Contact us immediately if:
- Sharp edges from a break (safety risk)
- Broken lens near eyes
- Electronics exposed from frame damage
- Damage during first week of ownership

**How to Contact Us**

Have your order number ready and include photos of any damage. This speeds up the process significantly!
