Title: My Frames Are Broken -- What Are My Options?
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: broken, frames, damage, warranty, options, cracked, snapped

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

We're sorry your Lucyd frames are damaged! Here are your options.

The path forward depends on two factors: when you bought them and how the damage happened.

STEP 1: DETERMINE YOUR COVERAGE

• Within 1 year + Manufacturing defect → Full warranty replacement
• Within 1 year + Accidental damage → Not covered by warranty (see options below)
• Within 2 years + Lucyd Pro Insurance → Insurance claim (deductible applies)
• Over 1 year + No insurance → Out of warranty (see options below)

IF IT'S A MANUFACTURING DEFECT (WARRANTY)

Signs of a manufacturing defect:
• Hinge broke during normal use (no drop/impact)
• Frame cracked at a stress point without impact
• Temple snapped while putting on/removing glasses
• Joint separated with normal handling

What to do:
1. Contact us with your order number
2. Send 2-3 photos from different angles
3. Describe how/when the damage happened
4. We'll review and process a warranty replacement

IF IT'S ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE

Drops, impacts, sitting on glasses, and similar accidents are not covered by the standard warranty. Your options:

Option A: Lucyd Pro Insurance Claim
If you purchased Lucyd Pro, file an insurance claim. Small deductible applies, full replacement provided.

Option B: Discounted Replacement
Special pricing for existing customers on a new pair. Contact us for current offers.

Option C: Paid Repair
Some damage can be repaired for a fee. Send photos and we'll quote a repair price.

Option D: Upgrade Trade-In
Trade your damaged pair toward new Lucyd glasses. Ask about current trade-in programs.

WHAT ABOUT MY PRESCRIPTION LENSES?

If your lenses are undamaged, they may be transferable to a replacement frame of the same model. Ask us when you contact support.

READY TO GET HELP?

Contact us with:
1. Your order number
2. 2-3 photos of the damage
3. Description of how it happened
4. Whether you have Lucyd Pro insurance

Title: How to Photograph Damage for a Warranty Claim
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: photos, damage, warranty, claim, evidence

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

Good photos help us process your claim faster!

Sending clear photos of the damage reduces back-and-forth and helps us resolve your claim quickly.

WHAT WE NEED: 2-3 PHOTOS

Photo 1: Overall View
• Hold glasses at arm's length
• Show the full frame with damage visible
• Good lighting, no shadows on the damage

Photo 2: Close-Up of Damage
• Get as close as possible to the broken area
• Make sure the damage is in focus
• Show the break point clearly

Photo 3: Detail Shot (if applicable)
• If both sides of a break are visible, show how they separated
• If hinge damage, show the hinge area close-up
• If multiple damage points, photograph each one

PHOTO TIPS

DO:
• Use good, natural lighting
• Hold the camera steady (rest on a table if needed)
• Take photos on a plain, contrasting background
• Make sure the damage area is in sharp focus
• Include something for scale if helpful (coin, finger)

DON'T:
• Use flash directly on the damage (causes glare)
• Take photos in dim lighting
• Send blurry or out-of-focus images
• Photograph from far away only

COMMON DAMAGE TYPES & BEST ANGLES

• Broken hinge → Side view showing hinge separation
• Cracked frame → Front view + close-up of crack
• Snapped temple → Show both pieces and break point
• Nose bridge crack → Top-down view + front view
• Joint separation → Side view showing gap

HOW TO SEND PHOTOS

• Reply to your support ticket with photos attached
• Or email to info@lucyd.co with your order number
• Accepted formats: JPG, PNG (under 10MB each)

Title: Warranty vs Accidental Damage: What's Covered?
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: warranty, accidental, coverage, damage, defect

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

Understanding what's covered helps set expectations and speeds up your claim.

MANUFACTURING DEFECT (WARRANTY COVERED)

A manufacturing defect means the product failed due to a flaw in materials or workmanship, NOT from external force.

Examples of covered defects:
• Hinge breaks during normal open/close action
• Frame cracks at a stress point without any impact
• Temple snaps while being worn or adjusted normally
• Nose bridge separates without being bent or dropped
• Screws fall out repeatedly despite being tightened
• Frame warps or bends permanently from normal body heat

Key indicator: The damage happened during normal, everyday use with no external force or accident.

ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE (NOT WARRANTY COVERED)

Accidental damage results from external force, misuse, or events beyond normal wear.

Examples of accidental damage:
• Dropped glasses and frame cracked
• Sat on glasses
• Stepped on glasses
• Glasses fell off head onto hard surface
• Pet chewed on frames
• Stored in back pocket and broke
• Bent frames trying to adjust fit
• Damage from extreme heat (left in hot car)

HOW WE DETERMINE THE CAUSE

We look at:
1. Break pattern — Clean snaps at stress points suggest defects; irregular breaks suggest impact
2. Location — Known weak points vs unusual locations
3. Timeline — Defects typically appear within months; impact damage is immediate
4. Photos — Visual evidence of the damage type

WHAT IF I DISAGREE?

If you believe your damage is a manufacturing defect and we've classified it as accidental:
• You can request a second review
• Provide additional context or photos
• Our team will re-evaluate

COVERAGE SUMMARY

Covered (Warranty):
• Hinge failure, stress cracks, joint separation, screw failure, material fatigue, normal use breakage

Not Covered (Accidental):
• Drops and impacts, sitting/stepping on, bending/forcing, pet damage, heat damage, water submersion damage

HAVE LUCYD PRO INSURANCE?

Lucyd Pro covers BOTH manufacturing defects AND accidental damage. If you purchased Lucyd Pro, you're covered either way!

Title: Frame Damage Assessment Guide
Category: Warranty & Protection (Internal Reference)
Tags: internal, assessment, damage, warranty, guide

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

This guide helps you understand how we assess frame damage claims.

COMMON FRAME FAILURE POINTS

• Hinge joint — Common cause: Repeated open/close — Usually defect if <12 months
• Temple mid-point — Common cause: Flexing/bending — Depends on force applied
• Nose bridge — Common cause: Stress from wear — Usually defect if no impact
• Frame front corners — Common cause: Impact point — Usually accidental
• Screw holes — Common cause: Material fatigue — Usually defect

FRAME MATERIALS & EXPECTED DURABILITY

Lucyd frames are designed for everyday use including:
• Daily wearing and removing
• Normal adjustment for fit
• Cleaning and handling
• Carrying in a pouch or case

WHEN TO SUSPECT A DEFECT

• Damage appears within the first 6 months
• Break occurs at a known stress point (hinge, joint)
• Customer describes normal use when damage occurred
• Similar reports from same batch/model
• Clean break pattern consistent with material failure

WHEN TO SUSPECT ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE

• Impact marks visible near break point
• Customer mentions a drop, sit-on, or similar event
• Break pattern shows external force (splintering, crushing)
• Damage at unusual location (not a stress point)
• Cosmetic scratches/scuffs suggesting rough handling

ASSESSMENT PROCESS

1. Request photos (see photo guide article)
2. Check purchase date and order history
3. Review customer's description of events
4. Examine break pattern in photos
5. Check for known issues with that model/batch
6. Make determination and communicate clearly

Title: Broken Frames FAQ: Hinges, Temples, Nose Bridge
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: broken, hinge, temple, nose bridge, FAQ

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

Common questions about specific types of frame damage.

HINGE ISSUES

Q: My hinge is loose. What should I do?
A: A loose hinge can sometimes be tightened. Try using a small eyeglass screwdriver on the hinge screw. If the screw won't hold or keeps loosening, contact us — this may be a warranty issue.

Q: The hinge broke completely. Is this covered?
A: If the hinge broke during normal use (opening/closing your glasses), this is typically a manufacturing defect covered under warranty. Send us photos and your order number.

Q: Can a broken hinge be repaired?
A: In some cases, yes. Send photos and we'll assess whether repair is possible or if a full replacement is needed.

TEMPLE (ARM) ISSUES

Q: One temple snapped off. Now what?
A: This depends on how it happened:
• Broke during normal wear → Likely warranty covered
• Broke from a drop or impact → Accidental damage (see options in "My Frames Are Broken" article)

Q: Can I get just one replacement temple?
A: Due to the electronics in each temple, individual temple replacement isn't available. We replace the full pair.

Q: The temple is bent. Can I straighten it?
A: Light bending for fit adjustment is okay. If the temple is significantly bent from an impact, don't force it — this can cause further damage. Contact us for options.

NOSE BRIDGE ISSUES

Q: The nose bridge cracked. What are my options?
A: Nose bridge cracks during normal wear are typically covered under warranty. Contact us with photos and your order number.

Q: The nose pads fell off. Can I replace them?
A: Yes! Replacement nose pads are available at lucyd.co/accessories. These are easy to replace yourself.

Q: The frame is too tight/loose on my nose.
A: Minor fit adjustments are normal. If the frame doesn't fit well, consider exchanging for a different size (free within 30 days).

GENERAL FRAME QUESTIONS

Q: How long should Lucyd frames last?
A: With proper care, Lucyd frames should last 2+ years. The 1-year warranty covers manufacturing defects. Lucyd Pro insurance extends protection to 2 years including accidental damage.

Q: Do you sell just frames without electronics?
A: No, Lucyd frames include integrated electronics. Replacement requires a full new pair.

Q: Can my prescription lenses be moved to a new frame?
A: Often yes, if the replacement is the same model and your lenses are undamaged. Ask us when filing your claim.

Title: Lucyd Pro Insurance: Is It Worth It?
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: insurance, Lucyd Pro, worth it, protection, value

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

Wondering if Lucyd Pro is a smart purchase? Here's an honest breakdown.

WHAT LUCYD PRO ADDS BEYOND STANDARD WARRANTY

Standard Warranty (Free):
• Manufacturing defects — 1 year
• Accidental drops — NOT covered
• Cracked/broken frames (if accidental) — NOT covered
• Water damage — NOT covered
• Theft — NOT covered

Lucyd Pro (Paid):
• Manufacturing defects — 2 years
• Accidental drops — COVERED
• Cracked/broken frames — COVERED
• Water damage — COVERED
• Theft — COVERED (with police report)

THE BIG QUESTION: FRAMES

25% of all support tickets involve broken frames. Without Lucyd Pro:
• Accidental frame damage = no free replacement
• You'll need to purchase a new pair or pay for repair
• Replacement cost is full retail price

With Lucyd Pro:
• Accidental frame damage = small deductible for replacement
• Covers drops, impacts, and accidents
• 2 claims during coverage period

WHO SHOULD GET LUCYD PRO?

Strongly recommended if you:
• Are active or play sports while wearing glasses
• Have a history of breaking glasses
• Chose Lucyd as your only pair of glasses
• Ordered expensive prescription lenses
• Work in environments where damage is likely
• Travel frequently

May not need it if you:
• Are very careful with eyewear
• Have backup glasses
• Primarily use indoors at a desk
• Ordered non-prescription (lower replacement cost)

COST COMPARISON

Think about it this way:
• Lucyd Pro cost: A fraction of a new pair
• Replacement without insurance: Full retail price
• If you use even one claim, Lucyd Pro typically saves you money

HOW TO PURCHASE

Lucyd Pro is available at checkout when ordering your glasses. It cannot be added after purchase.

BOTTOM LINE

If your Lucyd glasses are your primary eyewear, especially with prescription lenses, Lucyd Pro is a smart investment. The most common damage type (broken frames from accidental causes) is exactly what it covers.

Title: Common Frame Issues & When to Contact Us
Category: Warranty & Protection
Tags: frame, issues, common, preventive, care

--- PASTE BELOW THIS LINE ---

Know what's normal, what's fixable at home, and when to reach out.

NORMAL WEAR (NO ACTION NEEDED)

These are normal and don't require support:
• Minor scratches on frame surface after months of use
• Nose pads becoming slightly compressed over time
• Slight loosening of fit (can be adjusted)
• Temple tips softening with regular use

FIXABLE AT HOME

• Loose hinge screw → Tighten with eyeglass screwdriver
• Loose nose pads → Gently push back into place
• Temples too tight → Warm gently with hairdryer, bend outward slightly
• Temples too loose → Warm gently, bend inward slightly
• Dirty frame → Clean with mild soap and lukewarm water

Be Gentle: When adjusting temples, apply minimal force. Excessive bending can cause permanent damage.

CONTACT US FOR

High Priority:
• Hinge broken or cracked — Likely warranty or replacement needed
• Temple snapped — Cannot be repaired at home
• Nose bridge cracked — Structural damage
• Frame cracked anywhere — Replacement needed

Medium Priority:
• Screw won't hold despite tightening — May need thread repair
• Frame bent significantly — May affect electronics
• Repeated same issue — Quality concern

PREVENTIVE CARE TIPS

1. Always use two hands to put on and remove glasses
2. Store in the pouch when not wearing
3. Never place face-down on hard surfaces
4. Don't push up on the bridge with one finger (stresses the frame)
5. Avoid leaving in hot cars (heat can warp frames)
6. Don't wear on top of head (stretches temples)
7. Clean regularly (sweat and oils can degrade materials)

WHEN FRAME DAMAGE IS URGENT

Contact us immediately if:
• Sharp edges from a break (safety risk)
• Broken lens near eyes
• Electronics exposed from frame damage
• Damage during first week of ownership

HOW TO CONTACT US

Have your order number ready and include photos of any damage. This speeds up the process significantly!
