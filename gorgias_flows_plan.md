**Escalation Triggers (override to immediate human):**
- Customer disputes damage classification
- Repeat warranty claim (2nd+ claim on same order)
- Customer expresses frustration/anger → Trigger escalation flow
- Safety concern (sharp edges, lens near eyes) → URGENT priority
- Customer mentions legal action → Trigger Rule 4 override

**Must-Collect Information:**
1. Order number (required)
2. Purchase date / approximate timeline (required)
3. How damage happened - normal use vs accident (required)
4. 2-3 photos from different angles (required)
5. Whether customer has Lucyd Pro insurance (required for accidental)

**Resolution Criteria:**
- Customer is informed of their coverage status
- All required information collected
- Enriched ticket created for human review
- Customer given clear timeline (1 business day follow-up)

**Guardrails:**
- NEVER promise warranty coverage before human review
- NEVER process replacements directly -- always create ticket for human
- ALWAYS collect photos before classifying damage
- ALWAYS offer human handoff if customer expresses frustration
- Maximum 4 exchanges before offering direct agent connection

**Connected Macros:**
- `WARRANTY: Broken Frame Triage` (initial response)
- `WARRANTY: Damage Assessment - Defect` (warranty-eligible classification)
- `WARRANTY: Damage Assessment - Accidental` (out-of-warranty options)
- `WARRANTY: Lucyd Pro Insurance Claim Start` (insurance path)
